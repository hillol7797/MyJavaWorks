Read an English sentence from the terminal. Count and report the number of occurrences of the alphabetic letters (a through z) in it. Also report the total number of distinct alphabetic letters in the sentence. Make no distinction between upper and lower case letters, i.e., 'a' is treated the same as 'A', 'b' the same as 'B' and so on. Neglect non-alphabetic characters (digits, punctuation symbols etc.).
