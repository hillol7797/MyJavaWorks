 Write functions to perform the following tasks:

    Check if a positive integer (provided as parameter) is prime.
    Check if a positive integer (provided as parameter) is composite.
    Return the sum S7(n) of the 7-ary digits of a positive integer n (supplied as parameter). 


Use the above functions to find out the smallest positive integer i for which S7( pi ) is composite, where pi is the i-th prime. Also print the prime pi .

Note: 1 is neither prime nor composite. The sequence of primes is denoted by p1=2, p2=3, p3=5, p4=7, p5=11, ....

As an illustratuve example for this exercise consider the 31st prime p31 = 127 that expands in base 7 as

    127 = 2 * 72 + 4 * 7 + 1, 

i.e., the 7-ary expansion of 127 is 241 and therefore

    S7(127)=2+4+1=7, 

which is prime.
