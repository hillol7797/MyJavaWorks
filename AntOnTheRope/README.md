 An ant is sitting at the left end of a rope of length 10 cm. At t=0 the ant starts moving along the rope to reach the other end of the rope. The ant has a speed of 1 cm per second. After every second the rope stretches instantaneously and uniformly (along its length) by 10 cm with the left end fixed at the point from where the ant started its journey. Suppose that the ant's legs provide it sufficient friction in order to withstand the stretching of the rope without slipping. Write a program to demonstrate that the ant will be able to reach the right end of the rope. Your program should also calculate how many seconds the ant would take to achieve this goal. You may assume that the length of the ant is negligible (i.e., zero).
